# Mission to Mars

## Project Overview 

In this project using Mission to Mars as an example we learnt the below 
    
    * Use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
    * Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
    * Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
    * Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
    * Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the web application.
   
   
## Resources
 
##### Splinter 
 Splinter is the tool that will automate our web browser as we begin scraping.To do all of this, we'll need to install Splinter and ChromeDriver

##### Beautiful Soup

##### Flask PyMongo
Python developers think of MongoDB as a persistent, searchable repository of Python dictionaries (this is how PyMongo represents MongoDB documents). Flask-PyMongo bridges Flask and PyMongo and provides some convenience helpers.
